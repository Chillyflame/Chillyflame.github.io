    <h2>Benjimin Franklin</h2>
    <p>A small leak sinks a great ship.</p>
    <p>A penny saved is a penny earned.</p>
    <p>Every cloud has a silver lining.</p>
    <p>A word to the wise is enough.</p>
    <p>Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.</p>
    <p>
      If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either
      write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The World is full of fools and faint hearts, and yet every one has courage
      enough to bear the misfortunes, and wisdom enough to manage the Affairs of
      his neighbor.
